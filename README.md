ABOUT HotShotBot
-----------
HotShotBot is an AIML based Chat Bot written in C# -- a computer program you can talk to. 
It has an easy Installation.

HotShotBot is actually a very simple AIML Bot which actually designed to help you to create
your very first AIML Chatbot in C#.

HotShotBot IS HELPFUL:
---------------------
HotShotBot is able to answer most questions of the form "Who/what/where/when 
is/was/are/were X?" -- though his answers are occasionally more
entertaining than accurate. He can also help find the meaning of some  acronyms.

IT CAN SPEAK:
------------
Currently this feature is being served by using Microsoft Speech Recognition (Microsoft.Speech).

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
--------------------
I'm also planning to make it able to take speech input,but reliability is a concern .
He should someday be able to provide definitions or 
synonyms for any word in the dictionary, query your address book, and even
perform a few simple remote system-administration tasks!


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
HotShotBot has been tested on Windows 10,Windows 8,Windows 8.1.However,
he should work on any Microsoft system(or you can also use mono on linux):
 - .NET Framework
 -  Enough available RAM (depending on the AIML set you're using)
 


INSTALLATION
------------
HotShotBot could be Easily Installed by executing the "HotShotBot.exe" (Setup File) availabe at http://hotshotbot.sourceforge.net
The Installer is created using Inno Setup Compiler (www.innosetup.com).
